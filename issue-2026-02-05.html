          <p class="why">The duo behind Tribeca’s Frenchette and Upper West Side revival Le Veau d’Or , chefs Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, teamed up with indie film studio A24 ( Moonlight , Past Lives ) to create the buzziest downtown restaurant in October 2025. Attached to the reopened West Village Cherry Lane Theatre , every seat at Wild Cherry is a good one, even the tiny horseshoe bar, so you’ll have a high chance of celebrity-spotting from the likes of Bradley Cooper and Sabrina Carpenter while enjoying a varied menu ranging from frogs legs Kiev to standbys like an excellent cheeseburger.</p>

          <p class="why">One of NYC’s hottest restaurants is Lower East Side phenom Ha’s Snack Bar, and the team has expanded with a new, larger restaurant nearby in December. The menu still focuses on French Vietnamese dishes, but it’s more expansive, thanks to the legit kitchen. Find fried yuba stuffed with crab, a jazzed-up steak frites, curried lobster, and sweetbreads vol au vent. Reservations are already going fast.</p>

          <p class="why">Chef Sungchul Shim’s most intimate project yet is tucked inside his Times Square steakhouse, Gui , which opened in October 2025. At the 22-seat marble counter of Hwaro , Shim leans into Korean technique and heritage through a tasting menu built around a custom charcoal grill — the restaurant’s namesake braiser. The 13-course $295 menu is served around the circular counter, with dishes like foie gras served with duck terrine, mushroom pies, and scallops with truffles and makgeolli bearnaise espuma. There’s also a nine-course option for $245.</p>

          <p class="why">The restaurateur behind NYC Thai restaurants Malii Gramercy and When in Bangkok , Olie Sangpetpairot, expanded with this new restaurant, which opened in December 2025. The menu, from executive chef Kitipoom “Nicky” Khanarat and head chef Supattra “Tina” Thipdong, leans into a pan-regional approach done with contemporary touches, with items like scallop crudo with tom kha sorbet, pad Thai with shrimp tamarind sauce, and fish curry gratin, along with cocktails with pandan, chiles, and palm sugar. The decor for the spacious dining room takes its cues from its name, which is a Thai word for “moon,” leading to a moon mirror, warm lighting, and stones.</p>

          <p class="why">Seahorse is the splashy seafood brasserie from Mercer Street Hospitality and restaurateur John McDonald, which opened inside the revamped W New York in Union Square back in September 2025. Designed by Rockwell Group, the 125-seat room leans nautical — scallop tiles, midnight-blue banquettes, and a sea-themed mural — while chef John Villa sends out a menu that includes crudo, dover sole, and branzino, among other options, with flourishes like spicy lobster cavatelli, corn ravioli, and even duck a l’orange; a dessert cart and cocktails round it out.</p>

You can still find items like love letters among pastas, such as the 100-layer lasagna from Del Posto, now on this menu. But even with familiar items, Babbo seems revived by an infusion of energy and attention to detail in the front and back of the house.</p>

The team is also behind Corner Store , the celebrity magnet in Soho. The 35-seat steakhouse, which opened in September 2025, swaps the Frog Club’s froggy decor for velvet banquettes, geometric marble floors, and literary nods from Rockwell Group. Chef Michael Vignola’s menu moves from oysters with gin-celery mignonette and horseradish-snow shrimp to 30-day-aged rib-eyes and a cheesesteak. Cocktails are theatrical — smoked dirty martinis, fat-washed pours, fluffy margaritas.</p>

          <p class="why">Two-Michelin-starred Japanese kaiseki Odo spun off with Odo East Village in February, its comparatively casual restaurant with an elegant counter-seat space. It focuses on what chef Hiroki Odo and the team are calling “ kaiseki izakaya,” an a la carte menu with Japanese raw, grilled, simmered, steamed, and fried dishes. Think donburi with uno and soft-cooked eggs, rice cracker-breaded fried chicken, and Japanese crab.</p>

          <p class="why">Muku is a newer 10-seat kaiseki counter in Tribeca from the team behind Michelin-starred L’Abeille , led by chef Manabu Asanuma, which opened in September 2025. The minimalist space centers on a seasonal tasting menu that shifts from sashimi and delicate broths to grilled fish and composed vegetable dishes, evoking Kyoto traditions in a downtown setting.</p>

          <p class="why">Bufón is the swanky Lower East Side follow-up to West Village wine bar Demo , with chefs Quang Nguyen and Dina Fan, which opened in November 2025, channeling a menu that leans on steak, seafood, and, with that, a raw bar. Look for dishes like bluefin tuna carpaccio, beans with dried scallops and winter melon, grilled mackerel, a steak selection, and fries. There’s also a robust selection of natural wines from Jacob Nass and Pierre Derrien, plus a short list of cocktails.</p>

          <p class="why">This new Korean restaurant works as a daytime cafe and nighttime bar and restaurant since it opened in December. During the a.m. hours, find coffee flights, lychee co-ferment pour-overs, and tea sets. At night, Tera transforms into a natural wine and cocktail bar with Korean dishes like abalone jang bap as well as jeons and soothing gamte somen. The communal tatami has a no-shoes policy.</p>
