            <p class="why">If Ha’s Snack Bar was the starter, consider this to be the main course. Much bigger than its predecessor, Bistrot Ha builds on the legacy of thrilling Vietnamese French cuisine that Anthony Ha and Sadie Mae Burns have established as the duo behind globe-trotting pop-up, Ha’s Đặc Biệt. It takes its cues, lovingly and fittingly, from Paris (especially the iconic Bistrot Paul Bert) but the couple have made it uniquely their own. Leeks vinaigrette gets topped with Maggi and marinated mussels. Tomato fried rice is dotted with snails. Vol-au-vent is filled with curried lobster and sweetbreads. Beef hearts get a char-siu treatment. Whatever you do, don’t sleep on the desserts, especially if you see the ice cream bombe: It’s their version of a baked Alaska, made with layers of coffee caramel, coconut pandan, and black sesame ice cream enveloped in meringue — and it’s a pitch-perfect way to end your evening.</p>

            <p class="why">The duo behind Tribeca’s Frenchette and Upper West Side revival Le Veau d’Or , chefs Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, teamed up with indie film studio A24 ( Moonlight , Past Lives ) to create the buzziest downtown restaurant in October 2025. Attached to the reopened West Village Cherry Lane Theatre , every seat at Wild Cherry is a good one, even the tiny horseshoe bar, so you’ll have a high chance of celebrity-spotting from the likes of Bradley Cooper and Sabrina Carpenter while enjoying a varied menu ranging from frogs legs Kiev to standbys like an excellent cheeseburger.</p>

            <p class="why">Cove marks the evolution of chef Flynn McGarry’s (Gem, Gem Wine) fine-dining roots. That means his precision is balanced with whimsy, a melding of California cuisine with Northeast ingredients (many of which come from McGarry’s ownm Long Island farm) and a touch of Scandinavian influences, resulting in some of the most creative dishes you’ll find in the city today. There’s no better example of this than his take on schnitzel: It evokes the airy and crunchy layers of a perfectly fried tonkatsu, albeit composed entirely of breaded cabbage leaves stuffed with rye bread and maitake, accompanied by a tart quince mustard, hazelnuts roasted in butter, and a generous helping of cabbage salad. That same attention to care and detail extends to everything, from housemade non-alcoholic cocktails to a massive wine list curated by Paris McGarry Gil (Flynn’s older sister), and from the handsome strawberry blonde wood interiors to the sauna-esque waiting room — complete with a heating lamp — that shelters you from harsh winter winds outside.</p>

            <p class="why">Ramen is always a good idea, especially in this weather. Frankly, though, Rasheeda Purdie’s ramen renditions with a decidedly breakfast-style twist transcend any season, and we’re so elated she’s back after closing her Bowery Market stall last March. Whether you opt for her signature smoked bacon, soy-marinated egg, and parmesan cheese ramen or try one of her newer dishes, like the maple sausage and soy yolk ramen, you simply can’t go wrong. (We’re personally very fond of the everything egg drop ramen, which is now also available in a vegetarian version.) Pair your ramen with a selection of refreshing teas or zero-proof sippers, and do consider adding a filled bao while you’re at it, too. Pro tip: Reservations are a must; the East Village space only has room for about five diners at a time.</p>

            <p class="why">Stars is assuredly a wine bar, and it punctuates that in a number of ways, from the diminutive size — just 12 seats — to a walk-ins-only policy, a compact list of snacks, and an outsize list of excellent wines. But Stars also isn’t just any wine bar; it’s a wine bar from the team behind Claud and Penny , and like its predecessors, Stars knows how to deliver exactly what you want. On any given night that might mean creamy deviled eggs topped with delicate star-shaped pommes souffles, complemented by a crisp Loire chenin blanc. Or a rustic-presenting mix of marinated vegetables and chorizo, to accompany a bit of Beaujolais. Whether you opt for a quick drink or a longer interlude, you’ll never leave disappointed.</p>

            <p class="why">The original Falansai in Bushwick was the definition of a low-key gem, and the new iteration, now located in Greenpoint in the former Pan Pan Vino Vino space, continues that  legacy. Chef-owner Eric Tran doles out innovative blends of Vietnamese and Mexican cooking with the precision you’d come to expect from a chef who worked at Blue Hill at Stone Barns and West Village classics like Joseph Leonard. There are many standout dishes, chief among them the tuna crunch No. 1 that features a fried sesame rice cracker topped with cubes of fresh tuna and guacamole, comforting Vietnamese tamales with confit duck neck, and a standout lamb neck braised in pho spices, paired with corn tortillas and an array of housemade sauces. Expect to see some daytime offerings from Tran and his team in the near future, as well as (we hope) the return of Falansai’s incredible dac biet tasting menu.</p>

            <p class="why">Oku opened in 2023 on a very specific premise: that, yes, there’s no shortage of omakase spots in New York, but what about one in inside a former pizzeria? And not just any pizzeria, but the old Scarr’s space on Orchard Street. The decór was largely left as is, aside from some memorabilia being swapped out with Japanese equivalents, and of course the tweaking of the interior to accommodate a stark white eight-seat sushi counter. A few years in, we can safely say none of this is contrivance; executive chef Kei Yoshino takes his craft seriously, and it shows throughout the delightful omakase ($100 per person at the counter and $85 in the dining room). The chef also offers a variety of à la carte options from otsumami like his signature egg sundae (uni, ikura, caviar, and mochi) to temaki and more.</p>

            <p class="why">Lovely and lively, this Levantine bistro from the owner of storied Midtown French bistro La Bonne Soupe offers an array of dishes that draw their influences from Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine, and all to delicious effect, thanks to the work of chef Omneyah Hassan ( Pasquale Jones and Legacy Records), a Queens native whose parents originally hail from Alexandria. You’ll want to start your meal with the Arak Baladi or a glass of Lebanese wine, and from there, it’ll be a tough call as to what you should order. Our suggestion? Don’t forgo the charred eggplant with a luscious black garlic toum, the batata harra, or the tortellini-like shish barak, swathed in a bright and tangy yogurt sauce.</p>

            <p class="why">There is no dearth of excellent pizza in New York, and Il Leone is the latest entrant to uphold that great city tradition, taking over the space that previously was Bar Vinazo. Ben Wexler-Waite’s Neapolitan-style pies are seemingly simple but they yield flavors and tastes that are far more complex than they let on. Yes, you’re likely to encounter its quickly canonical lobster pizza when you go, but do consider other dishes on the menu, including a stellar, tender, and downright juicy polpette, expertly pan-fried baby artichokes, as well as their premium margherita del leone and seasonal white pie, currently made with a mix of locally foraged mushrooms.</p>

            <p class="why">Long before the success of Dhamaka and Semma , Adda was where chef Chintan Pandya and restaurateur Roni Mazumdar first developed their ethos of serving Indian food in a way that was their own, in a tiny storefront in Queens. Last year, they decided to finally move Adda to a new East Village location, and although the new address is bigger and showier, it’s clear they haven’t lost sight of what made their keystone restaurant so special. You’ll still find favorites like the bheja (goat brain) masala and the goat biryani, but they’ve also expanded the menu handsomely to include even more, like Nagaland pork fry and a vegetarian pulao studded with morels. And together with chef de cuisine Neel Kajale, they’ve continued their quest to make diners reconsider what Indian food can be. Case in point: The much-talked-about butter chicken experience, a tableside endeavor that involves your choice of compound butter and wood chips for smoking a whole heritage Green Circle chicken.</p>

            <p class="why">Many bars claim to have a little something for everyone, but few heed that sentiment like Golden Ratio, which comes from the same team behind Cafe Mado and Place des Fêtes . In this sense, it’s clearly an overachiever: For every cocktail on the menu, there’s a non-alcoholic counterpart that’s not just the same recipe, sans the alcohol — but instead a wholly independent and unique creation. Together, both drinks aim to embody the essence of whatever ingredient they’re focused on, from purple shiso and apple to toothache tree and parsnip. And as exceptional as the cocktails are, the bar snacks are equally impressive, like smoked sunchoke profiteroles and butter toast topped with savory anchovies and bonito butter. But whatever you do, don’t sleep on the crispy hake, with a featherlight crumb exterior and a rich, garlicky aioli to pair with it all.</p>

            <p class="why">If there were ever a season that this restaurant — the second from chef Ed Szymanski and restaurateur Patricia Howard ( Dame , Crevette ) — could, and should, claim, it would be winter. Their supremely cozy English bistro that feels like an English country home boasts menus filled with pure comfort and joy: curried lamb Scotch egg; crispy pig’s head with an endive remoulade; grilled mushrooms with marmite hollandaise; and a short rib, carrot, and stilton pie with mashed potatoes. Better yet, they’re now offering brunch on the weekends, and offering their much-loved and previously scarce Welsh rarebit cheeseburger, too. So, what are you waiting for?</p>

Quique Crudo’s menu celebrates the sea, with everything from a whole lobster ceviche and shrimp aguachile to crab tostadas and fried oysters, along with a few dishes from the land, like creamy guacamole with totopos, a bright baby gem salad, and sopecitos with chorizo. Don’t sleep on the steak tartare tostada, either, or a mezcal Negroni. And save room for some housemade ice cream for dessert. P.S. Did we mention they now take reservations, too? You’re welcome.</p>

There’s a new owner, some updated decor touches, and the ability to pay with credit cards now but, most importantly, the recipes remain the same. What made the original Absolute Bagels — and this latest reincarnation — so special was the bagel itself: hand-rolled, kettle-boiled, oven-baked, and exceedingly fresh, with a crisp crust and soft, fluffy insides.</p>

            <p class="why">First of all, if you haven’t yet had the flour tortillas from Corima , served simply with a serving of recado negro butter, you need to amend that quickly. Second, know that you can find their excellent tortillas and so much more now in Park Slope at Vato , a handsome bakery and all-day cafe that the team opened in November. You can purchase some tortillas to take home and while you’re there; you should also purchase some delightful conchas filled with yuzu curd, a sumptuous churro, and an incredible sourdough cinnamon bun with copious, generous layer of vanilla frosting. Then, of course, there are the burritos with the aforementioned tortillas; we’re partial to the classic bean and cheese, or the hearty burnt ends with egg and cheese, no doubt a reference to the chef Fidel Caballero’s upbringing in both Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas.</p>

Now that they’re serving up their signature phở, there’s no excuse not to visit. Another must-order is their bún dau mam tôm, a bountiful platter of grilled pork intestines, housemade blood sausage, sticky rice sausage, and tofu, along with fresh herbs and rice vermicelli, all to be dipped in a pungent fermented shrimp paste. (They also have an entirely vegan version.) Whatever you do, don’t skip the tofu; they make it in house. P.S. The Heads are working on a new spot, Phê , on the same block, too, with Vietnamese coffee service, and bánh mì.</p>

            <p class="why">Markette, from chef India Doris (formerly of Crown Shy and Saga ) is at its best when it delves into the personal, drawing from Doris’ Jamaican and Scottish heritage while growing up in London. That translates into memorable dishes like her signature peri peri chicken bursting with flavor, and light-as-air salt cod fritters paired with a fiery scotch bonnet aioli. Other standouts not to be missed? Braised oxtail atop a gratin of crispy cheddar polenta, and grilled lamb served with curried lentils, fluffy pita, and crispy rice. Don’t leave without ordering at least one dessert, especially whatever rendition of a cheesecake they have at the moment. All together, everything makes for a meal that’ll linger with you, and that leaves an impression.</p>

            <p class="why">Here’s a willful departure from most of the city’s other Malaysian restaurants: a deeply personal effort from the same family behind Sunset Park’s critically acclaimed Hainan Chicken House . While you will find a stellar Hainanese poached chicken on the menu, the rest of the bill of fare isn’t afraid to play fast and loose with Malaysian standards. Rendang made with oxtails displays Caribbean influences. Flaky roti paratha sits atop a bed of red lentil dahl. Ravioli gets stuffed with lime leaf ricotta, nestled in a plate of brodo. You get the picture. All of it is the result of chef and owner Chris Low, who dreamt up these dishes while slowly assuming more of a prominent role in his father’s chicken restaurant. Kelang itself is a true family affair, with the entire Low family pitching in to make it a reality, and it’s a difference you can taste.</p>

            <p class="why">Now that it’s officially cozy season, keep Cafe Rue Dix in your rotation of cozy locales. Why? Because you’re bound to feel right at home the moment you pull up a chair at this Senegalese-French restaurant, a neighborhood staple for more than a decade. With its cozy bistro-inspired setting, and hearty mix of fare, you’re bound to leave feeling full and satisfied. Our favorite picks? A steamy platter of thiebou djeun (Senegal’s national dish of jollof rice and fish), the spicy mafe (beef stew cooked with a creamy peanut butter sauce), and steak frites, paired with some café Touba (traditional Senegalese coffee blended with spices).</p>

            <p class="why">Since 2020, acclaimed chef Marc Forgione has been the faithful steward of this longtime neighborhood standby first owned by chef Frank DeCarlo and, over time, he’s remained true to its legacy, while also evolving it into a place all his own. With a chill in the air, there’s no better time to find solace in the woodfired cooking that Peasant has always been known for, whether you indulge in the signature suckling pig, the supremely comforting Borlotti beans, or the roasted skate wing. And then there’s the all-Italian wine list, overseen by Michael Laudenslager, that’s a perfect accompaniment to any and all of the dishes on the menu.</p>

            <p class="why">Now in its 50th year or business, Raoul’s remains an institution — a restaurant that embodies your classic downtown New York bistro, and still delivers. It’s a place to see and be seen. A place to grab a burger with fries and an ice-cold martini at the bar. A place to cultivate regular status . A timeless place to make you feel like you’re part of a long history of New York diners who have walked through its doors. Whatever you’re seeking when you go, you’re sure to find it. And while you’re there, do consider the jumbo lump crab beignets, steak tartare, heirloom pork rillette, the steak (but of course), and the trout amandine while you’re at it.</p>

            <p class="why">Chef Sungchul Shim’s most intimate project yet is tucked inside his Times Square steakhouse, Gui , which opened in October 2025. At the 22-seat marble counter of Hwaro , Shim leans into Korean technique and heritage through a tasting menu built around a custom charcoal grill — the restaurant’s namesake braiser. The 13-course $295 menu is served around the circular counter, with dishes like foie gras served with duck terrine, mushroom pies, and scallops with truffles and makgeolli bearnaise espuma. There’s also a nine-course option for $245.</p>

            <p class="why">The restaurateur behind NYC Thai restaurants Malii Gramercy and When in Bangkok , Olie Sangpetpairot, expanded with this new restaurant, which opened in December 2025. The menu, from executive chef Kitipoom “Nicky” Khanarat and head chef Supattra “Tina” Thipdong, leans into a pan-regional approach done with contemporary touches, with items like scallop crudo with tom kha sorbet, pad Thai with shrimp tamarind sauce, and fish curry gratin, along with cocktails with pandan, chiles, and palm sugar. The decor for the spacious dining room takes its cues from its name, which is a Thai word for “moon,” leading to a moon mirror, warm lighting, and stones.</p>

Designed by Rockwell Group, the 125-seat room leans nautical — scallop tiles, midnight-blue banquettes, and a sea-themed mural — while chef John Villa sends out a menu that includes crudo, dover sole, and branzino, among other options, with flourishes like spicy lobster cavatelli, corn ravioli, and even duck a l’orange; a dessert cart and cocktails round it out.</p>

You can still find items like love letters among pastas, such as the 100-layer lasagna from Del Posto, now on this menu. But even with familiar items, Babbo seems revived by an infusion of energy and attention to detail in the front and back of the house.</p>

The 35-seat steakhouse, which opened in September 2025, swaps the Frog Club’s froggy decor for velvet banquettes, geometric marble floors, and literary nods from Rockwell Group. Chef Michael Vignola’s menu moves from oysters with gin-celery mignonette and horseradish-snow shrimp to 30-day-aged rib-eyes and a cheesesteak. Cocktails are theatrical — smoked dirty martinis, fat-washed pours, fluffy margaritas.</p>

            <p class="why">Two-Michelin-starred Japanese kaiseki Odo spun off with Odo East Village in February, its comparatively casual restaurant with an elegant counter-seat space. It focuses on what chef Hiroki Odo and the team are calling “ kaiseki izakaya,” an a la carte menu with Japanese raw, grilled, simmered, steamed, and fried dishes. Think donburi with uno and soft-cooked eggs, rice cracker-breaded fried chicken, and Japanese crab.</p>

            <p class="why">Muku is a newer 10-seat kaiseki counter in Tribeca from the team behind Michelin-starred L’Abeille , led by chef Manabu Asanuma, which opened in September 2025. The minimalist space centers on a seasonal tasting menu that shifts from sashimi and delicate broths to grilled fish and composed vegetable dishes, evoking Kyoto traditions in a downtown setting.</p>

            <p class="why">Bufón is the swanky Lower East Side follow-up to West Village wine bar Demo , with chefs Quang Nguyen and Dina Fan, which opened in November 2025, channeling a menu that leans on steak, seafood, and, with that, a raw bar. Look for dishes like bluefin tuna carpaccio, beans with dried scallops and winter melon, grilled mackerel, a steak selection, and fries. There’s also a robust selection of natural wines from Jacob Nass and Pierre Derrien, plus a short list of cocktails.</p>

During the a.m. hours, find coffee flights, lychee co-ferment pour-overs, and tea sets. At night, Tera transforms into a natural wine and cocktail bar with Korean dishes like abalone jang bap as well as jeons and soothing gamte somen. The communal tatami has a no-shoes policy.</p>
